[![CRAN\_Status\_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/simsurv)](http://www.r-pkg.org/pkg/simsurv) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPL%20%28%3E=%203%29-brightgreen.svg)](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html)

**simsurv** is an R package that allows the user to simulate survival times from any user-specified hazard function. The hazard function is allowed to be time-dependent, and the resulting cumulative hazard function does not need to have a closed-form solution. The package is based on the approach described in Crowther and Lambert (2013), whereby the cumulative hazard is evaluated using numerical quadrature and survival times are generated using an iterative algorithm which nests the quadrature-based evaluation of the cumulative hazard inside Brent's (1973) univariate root finder. Not requiring a closed form solution to the cumulative hazard function has the benefit that survival times can be generated for complex models such as joint longitudinal and survival models; the package documentation provides an example of this.

**Note:** Please note that the version available on GitHub is the most up-to-date *development* version of the package. A stable version of the package will be available from CRAN once it is released.

Getting Started
---------------

### Installation

You can install **simsurv** directly from GitHub using the **devtools** package. To do this you should first check you have devtools installed by executing the following commands from within your R session:

``` r
if (!require(devtools)) {
  install.packages("devtools")
}
```

Then execute the following commands to install **simsurv**:

``` r
library(devtools)
install_github("sambrilleman/simsurv")
```

Example
-------

In this section we present an example showing how the **simsurv** package's main function can be used to simulate survival times based on a joint longitudinal and survival model. (In most instances, simulating survival times from a joint longitudinal and survival model can pose difficulties since time-dependency in the hazard function leads to there not being a general closed form solution to the integral when evaluating the cumulative hazard).

First we define the hazard function to pass to `simsurv`. This function must be defined by the user and must use three named arguments: `t`, which is the time variable; `x`, which is a data frame with each row containing the covariate values for one individual; `pars`, which is a data frame with each row containing the "true" parameter values for one individual. The function must return the hazard evaluated at time `t`. We will define the hazard function for a Weibull proportional hazards regression submodel from a joint longitudinal and survival model with a so-called "current value" association structure, where the hazard at time *t* depends on the expected value of the longitudinal outcome also evaluated at time *t*.

``` r
weibull_ph_hazfn <- function(t, x, pars) {
  pars[["shape"]] * (t ^ (pars[["shape"]] - 1)) * exp(
    pars[["betaEvent_intercept"]] +
    pars[["betaEvent_binary"]] * x[["Z1"]] +
    pars[["betaEvent_continuous"]] * x[["Z2"]] +
    pars[["betaEvent_assoc"]] * (
      pars[["betaLong_intercept"]] +
      pars[["betaLong_slope"]] * t +
      pars[["betaLong_binary"]] * x[["Z1"]] +
      pars[["betaLong_continuous"]] * x[["Z2"]]
    )
  )
}
```

Then we construct data frames with the true parameter values and the covariate data for each individual:

``` r
set.seed(5454) # set seed before simulating data
N <- 20        # number of individuals

# Population (fixed effect) parameters
betas <- data.frame(
  shape                = rep(2,    N),
  betaEvent_intercept  = rep(-11.9,N),
  betaEvent_binary     = rep(0.6,  N),
  betaEvent_continuous = rep(0.08, N),
  betaEvent_assoc      = rep(0.03, N),
  betaLong_binary      = rep(-1.5, N),
  betaLong_continuous  = rep(1,    N),
  betaLong_intercept   = rep(90,   N),
  betaLong_slope       = rep(2.5,  N)
)

# Individual-specific (random effect) parameters
b_corrmat <- matrix(c(1, 0.5, 0.5, 1), 2, 2)
b_sds     <- c(20, 3)
b_means   <- rep(0, 2)
b_z       <- MASS::mvrnorm(n = N, mu = b_means, Sigma = b_corrmat)
b         <- sapply(1:length(b_sds), function(x) b_sds[x] * b_z[,x])
betas$betaLong_intercept <- betas$betaLong_intercept + b[,1]
betas$betaLong_slope     <- betas$betaLong_slope     + b[,2]

# Covariate data
covs <- data.frame(
  Z1 = rbinom(N, 1, 0.45), # a binary covariate
  Z2 = rnorm(N, 44, 8.5)   # a continuous covariate
)
```

Then we simulate the survival times based on the hazard function (passed to the `hazfn` argument), the covariate values for each individual (passed to the `x` argument), and true parameter values for each individual (passed to the `pars` argument). We will also censor individuals with survival times greater than 10 years (or whatever time units we have assumed to be using) by specifying the `maxt` argument:

``` r
s1 <- simsurv(hazfn = weibull_ph_hazfn, x = covs, pars = betas, maxt = 10)
head(s1)
#>   eventtime status
#> 1  3.960496      1
#> 2  8.349806      1
#> 3  6.237878      1
#> 4  4.072384      1
#> 5  2.302704      1
#> 6  6.836110      1
```
