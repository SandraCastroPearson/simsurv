Description: Simulates survival times from any user-specified hazard function.
    The hazard function is allowed to be time-dependent, and the resulting
    cumulative hazard function does not need to have a closed-form solution. 
    The cumulative hazard is evaluated using Gauss-Kronrod quadrature and 
    survival times are generated using a combination of the method in Bender 
    et al. (2005) and Brent's (1973) univariate root finder. Not requiring a 
    closed form solution to the cumulative hazard function has the benefit that 
    survival times can be generated for complex models such as joint 
    longitudinal and survival models; the package documentation provides some 
    examples of this.
