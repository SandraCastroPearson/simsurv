Description: Simulate survival times from standard parametric survival 
    distributions (exponential, Weibull, Gompertz), 2-component mixture 
    distributions, or a user-defined [log] hazard function. Baseline 
    covariates can be included under a proportional hazards assumption.
    The 2-component mixture distributions can allow for a variety of flexible
    baseline hazard functions. If the user wishes to provide a user-defined 
    [log] hazard function then this is also possible, and the resulting
    cumulative hazard function does not need to have a closed-form solution. 
    Note that this package is modelled on the survsim package available in 
    the Stata software (see Crowther and Lambert (2012, 2013)).
